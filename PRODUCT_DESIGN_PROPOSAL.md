# faro-shuffle: AI-Powered Task Complexity Analysis & Expansion

## 1. Context & Goals

faro-shuffle is an AI-powered system designed to analyze task complexity and automatically break down large tasks into manageable subtasks. It integrates with existing project management workflows to provide:

- Automated complexity assessment of project phases/tasks
- Intelligent decomposition of complex tasks into atomic subtasks
- Standardized inputs and outputs that work across different project structures
- Integration with editor workflows via MCP (Message Control Protocol)

**Problem Statement:** Software development tasks are notoriously difficult to estimate accurately. Large tasks often hide complexity that only becomes apparent during implementation, leading to missed deadlines and scope creep. Manual task breakdown is time-consuming and prone to oversight.

**Target Audience:** Software development teams, project managers, and individual developers working with task-based workflows.

**Success Metrics:**
- Reduction in estimation errors by 30%
- Decrease in blocked/stalled tasks by 25% 
- Increase in sprint completion rates by 20%
- Developer satisfaction with task clarity (measured via surveys)

## 3. User Flows

### Developer Flow
1. **Analysis Request:** Developer selects a task/phase for analysis via editor command or CLI
2. **Context Gathering:** System examines relevant files, project structure, and previous tasks
3. **LLM Processing:** Task is analyzed by LLM with project-specific context
4. **Review Results:** Developer reviews generated subtasks and complexity assessment
5. **Task Management:** Subtasks are created in issue tracker (optional integration)

    LLM System->>faro-shuffle: Return analysis
    faro-shuffle->>Developer: Present subtasks & complexity
    Developer->>Issue Tracker: Create subtasks (optional)
```

### Project Manager Flow
1. **Bulk Analysis:** PM selects multiple tasks/phases for analysis
2. **Resource Planning:** System provides total effort estimates and identifies high-risk areas
3. **Sprint Planning:** PM uses subtask breakdown to assign work or adjust timelines
4. **Progress Tracking:** Subtask completion provides granular progress visibility

- Sidebar panel displaying results
- Inline annotations showing subtask boundaries
- Context menu options on task identifiers

### Web Interface (Future)
- Dashboard showing project-wide complexity metrics
- Kanban-style view of tasks and subtasks
- Filtering by complexity, risk level, and dependencies
- Integration with issue trackers (GitHub, JIRA)

## 5. Accessibility & Inclusivity
