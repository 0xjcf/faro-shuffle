# Add User Authentication to Web App

Need to implement user authentication for the web application. Should include:
- Login form with email/password
- Registration flow with email verification
- Password reset functionality
- JWT token implementation for API authentication
- User profile page with account settings
- Role-based access control (admin vs regular users)
- Session management
- Security features (rate limiting, CSRF protection)
- Integration with existing user database
