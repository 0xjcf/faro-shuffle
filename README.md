# üÉè faro-shuffle

**Know instantly if your project is a 2-hour tweak or a 2-week trap‚Äîbefore you waste time.**

`faro-shuffle` is an AI-powered task complexity analyzer that helps developers, freelancers, and project managers avoid time estimation disasters. It uses local AI to analyze your task descriptions and provide an objective complexity score with rationale.

## The Problem

Ever wasted 12 hours on a task that *should've* taken 2? Or worse, started something that turned into a 2-week nightmare?

Task complexity is notoriously difficult to estimate. We tend to:
- Underestimate complex tasks (optimism bias)
- Overlook hidden dependencies
- Miss edge cases that explode complexity

## The Solution

`faro-shuffle` tells you up front how hard a task really is‚Äîand why‚Äîbefore you commit to it:

- **Simple CLI workflow**: Write your task in markdown, get an instant complexity score
- **Local AI analysis**: Uses your Ollama instance for privacy and speed
- **Actionable insights**: Get recommendations based on complexity score
- **No configuration needed**: Works out of the box with sensible defaults

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Rust toolchain (install via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/))
- [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) running locally with the `llama3` model

```bash
# Install Ollama if you haven't already (macOS example)
curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh

# Pull the llama3 model (if you don't have it)
ollama pull llama3

# Make sure Ollama is running
ollama serve
```

### Building from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/faro-shuffle.git
cd faro-shuffle

# Build the project
cargo build --release

# Move binary to your path (optional)
cp target/release/faro_shuffle /usr/local/bin/faro-shuffle
```

## Usage

1. Create a markdown file with your task description:

```markdown
# Add User Authentication to Web App

Need to implement user authentication for the web application. Should include:
- Login form with email/password
- Registration flow
- Password reset functionality
- JWT token implementation
- User profile page
```

2. Analyze the task:

```bash
faro-shuffle analyze path/to/task.md
```

3. Get your complexity score and insights:

```
üìä Task Complexity Analysis
---------------------------
üî¢ Complexity Score: 7 / 10
üí° Rationale: Authentication involves security considerations, multiple user flows, 
and JWT implementation, making it moderately complex.

üìù Recommendation:
  This is a complex task. Allow for unexpected challenges.
```

# Project Kickoff: faro-shuffle

## üéØ Overall Vision & Goal
faro-shuffle is a modular system that uses AI to analyze task complexity and automatically generate subtasks. It provides standardized inputs/outputs that work across different project structures and integrates with existing workflows through MCP, CLI, and potentially API interfaces.

---

## üß© Core Components / Systems

1.  **Core Analysis Engine:** Parses tasks, gathers context, and analyzes complexity using LLM.
2.  **LLM Integration Layer:** Connects to various LLM providers with standardized prompts and fallbacks.
3.  **Input Interfaces:** CLI and MCP module for editor integration.
4.  **Output Formatters:** Standardized JSON, Markdown, and console reporting.
5.  **Project Context Parser:** Analyzes project structure, file contents, and dependencies.

        E --> F[Display to Console];
    end
```

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

**Note:** These instructions cover the minimal V1 setup focusing on the core engine and CLI. The full vision in this README includes components planned for later phases.

1.  `# git clone https://github.com/your-org/faro-shuffle.git  # Replace with actual repo URL`
2.  `cd faro-shuffle`
3.  Ensure `../dev-setup` exists relative to this directory.
4.  Ensure `justfile` (this project's task runner) exists in this directory.
5.  Run `just setup` (This will bootstrap V1 components and configure the environment using tasks defined in the `justfile`).

    *Alternatively, run `just bootstrap` first, then `direnv allow` manually.*
