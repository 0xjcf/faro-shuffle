**Coordinator:** [Name]  

## Dependency Types

| Type | Description | Notation | Impact |
|------|-------------|----------|--------|
| Finish-to-Start (FS) | Task B cannot start until Task A is complete | A → B | Most restrictive, creates sequential flow |
| Start-to-Start (SS) | Task B cannot start until Task A starts | A ⇢ B | Allows parallel work with offset |
| Finish-to-Finish (FF) | Task B cannot finish until Task A finishes | A ⇥ B | Coordinates completion timing |
| Start-to-Finish (SF) | Task B cannot finish until Task A starts | A ⇠ B | Rare, used for just-in-time scheduling |
| Lag | Waiting period after predecessor | A →(+5d)→ B | Introduces buffer time |
| Lead | Overlap with predecessor | A →(-3d)→ B | Accelerates schedule through fast-tracking |

## Task Dependency Matrix

| Task ID | Task Name | Predecessors | Relationship | Successors | Relationship | Est. Duration | Buffer |
|---------|-----------|--------------|--------------|------------|--------------|---------------|--------|
| T1 | [Task Name] | - | - | T2, T3 | FS, SS | [Duration] | [Buffer] |
| T2 | [Task Name] | T1 | FS | T4 | FS | [Duration] | [Buffer] |
| T3 | [Task Name] | T1 | SS | T4 | FS | [Duration] | [Buffer] |
| T4 | [Task Name] | T2, T3 | FS, FS | - | - | [Duration] | [Buffer] |

## Critical Path Analysis

### Critical Path Sequence
1. T1 → T2 → T4 (Total Duration: [X] days)

### Float Analysis

| Task ID | Task Name | Early Start | Early Finish | Late Start | Late Finish | Total Float | On Critical Path? |
|---------|-----------|-------------|--------------|------------|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| T1 | [Task Name] | [Date] | [Date] | [Date] | [Date] | 0 | Yes |
| T2 | [Task Name] | [Date] | [Date] | [Date] | [Date] | 0 | Yes |
| T3 | [Task Name] | [Date] | [Date] | [Date] | [Date] | 5 | No |
| T4 | [Task Name] | [Date] | [Date] | [Date] | [Date] | 0 | Yes |

## Resource Dependency Analysis

| Resource | Tasks | Constraint Type | Mitigation Strategy |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| [Resource] | T1, T3 | Shared resource | [Strategy] |
| [Resource] | T2 | Limited availability | [Strategy] |

## Risk Assessment

| Dependency | Risk Level | Impact | Probability | Mitigation Plan |
|------------|------------|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| T1 → T2 | High | Delays entire critical path | Medium | [Plan] |
| T3 → T4 | Medium | Extends project by up to 3 days | Low | [Plan] |

## Dependency Visualization

```
T1 ──────────────→ T2 ──────→ T4
  └───────→ T3 ────────┘
```

## Dependency Reduction Strategies

| Current Dependency | Issue | Potential Solution | Benefit | Cost/Risk |
|--------------------|-------|-------------------|---------|-----------|
| T1 → T2 | Sequential bottleneck | Split T1 into T1a/T1b | T2 can start earlier | Added coordination overhead |
| T3 → T4 | Waiting on non-critical task | Reduce scope of T3 | Reduce risk of delay | Quality tradeoff |

## Schedule Compression Opportunities

| Scenario | Tasks Affected | Time Saved | Required Resources | Risks |
|----------|----------------|------------|-------------------|-------|
| Fast-tracking | T2 + T3 | 2 days | None | Rework if T2 changes |
| Crashing | T4 | 1 day | Additional developer | Budget impact, quality risk |
