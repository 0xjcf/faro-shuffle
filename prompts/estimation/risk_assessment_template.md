## Risk Severity Categories

| Category | Score Range | Required Action |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| Critical | 17-25 | Immediate mitigation required; may need project pause |
| High | 10-16 | Detailed mitigation plan required with owner and timeline |
| Medium | 5-9 | Monitor closely with defined contingency plans |
| Low | 3-4 | Standard monitoring, documented response |
| Very Low | 1-2 | Acknowledge and track in risk register |
