# Task Analysis Engine Implementation

## Phase Overview
This phase focuses on implementing the core analysis engine for faro-shuffle, which will parse tasks, integrate with LLM providers, and generate complexity scores and subtask breakdowns.

## Goals
- Develop robust task parsing capabilities
- Implement LLM prompting strategy for complexity analysis
- Create fundamental data structures for task representation
- Build the core analysis algorithms

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Task Parser Development
- Create structures to represent tasks and their attributes
- Implement parsing logic for different input formats (markdown, JSON)
- Add validation for required task fields
- Develop normalization logic for inconsistent inputs

### 2. LLM Integration
- Implement client for connecting to Ollama
- Create fallback mechanisms for other LLM providers
- Design prompt templates for task analysis
- Build response parsing and validation

### 3. Complexity Scoring
- Implement the complexity scoring algorithm
- Create weighted scoring mechanisms
- Develop confidence level calculations
- Add explanation generation for scores

### 4. Subtask Generation
- Design algorithms for task decomposition
- Implement dependency detection between subtasks
- Create effort estimation for subtasks
- Add validation to ensure complete coverage of original task

### 5. Core Output Formatting
- Implement basic JSON output structure
- Create simple console reporting
- Add serialization/deserialization logic
- Implement basic error reporting

## Success Criteria
- Can parse task descriptions from structured inputs
- Successfully connects to at least one LLM provider
- Generates consistent complexity scores for similar tasks
- Produces logical subtask breakdowns
- Outputs results in well-structured JSON format

## Dependencies
- Rust toolchain
- Access to at least one LLM API (Ollama, OpenAI, etc.)

## Technical Considerations
- Ensure robust error handling throughout
- Design for extensibility to add more LLM providers
- Create clear separation between parsing, analysis, and output components
- Focus on performance for potentially large task descriptions
- Implement comprehensive logging
