# MCP Module Implementation

## Phase Overview
This phase focuses on developing the Message Control Protocol (MCP) module for faro-shuffle, enabling seamless integration with code editors like Vim/Neovim and potentially other IDEs. This integration allows developers to analyze and expand tasks directly within their development environment.

## Goals
- Implement MCP protocol support for editor communication
- Create editor-specific integration modules
- Enable task analysis and expansion from within editors
- Provide real-time feedback and visualization in the editor
- Support editor-specific features and workflows

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. MCP Protocol Implementation
- Implement WebSocket server for MCP communication
- Create message format handlers for MCP protocol
- Develop session management for editor connections
- Add authentication and security measures

### 2. Editor Command Integration
- Implement command registration for editor integration
- Create command handlers for task analysis operations
- Develop parameter parsing from editor commands
- Add result routing back to the editor

### 3. Context Gathering
- Implement buffer content extraction
- Create file context gathering from editor
- Develop cursor position and selection awareness
- Add project structure detection through editor

### 4. UI Integration
- Implement split window or panel for results display
- Create syntax highlighting for analysis output
- Develop interactive elements for task navigation
- Add keyboard shortcuts and commands for interaction

### 5. Editor-Specific Modules
- Implement Vim/Neovim specific integration
- Create VSCode extension support (if applicable)
- Develop other editor integrations as needed
- Add configuration for editor-specific settings

## Success Criteria
- Successfully communicates with editors via MCP protocol
- Allows task analysis directly from editor commands
- Displays results within the editor environment
- Supports context-aware analysis using editor state
- Provides intuitive navigation of analysis results

## Dependencies
- Phase 1: Core Analysis Engine
- Phase 3: Output Formatters

## Technical Considerations
- Design for minimal editor performance impact
- Implement graceful handling of connection issues
- Support configuration through editor-native methods
- Ensure consistent experience across different editors
- Consider asynchronous processing for better responsiveness
- Develop clear documentation for editor plugin installation
