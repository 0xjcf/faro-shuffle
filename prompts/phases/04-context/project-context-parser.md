# Project Context Parser Implementation

## Phase Overview
This phase focuses on developing the project context parser, which enhances task analysis by understanding the structure, dependencies, and technologies within the project. This contextual awareness allows for more accurate complexity assessment and subtask generation.

## Goals
- Create a system for analyzing project structure
- Detect technologies and frameworks used
- Map dependencies between components
- Extract contextual information for LLM prompts
- Enhance analysis accuracy with project-specific knowledge

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. File System Analysis
- Implement directory traversal and structure mapping
- Create file type detection and categorization
- Add filtering for relevant project files
- Develop size and complexity analytics for project components

### 2. Technology Detection
- Implement detection for common languages and frameworks
- Create package/dependency file parsing (package.json, Cargo.toml, etc.)
- Add version and compatibility analysis
- Build technology stack profiling

### 3. Code Structure Analysis
- Implement basic code parsing for common languages
- Create function and class relationship mapping
- Develop module/component dependency graphs
- Add complexity metrics for code components

### 4. Context Integration
- Design context inclusion in LLM prompts
- Implement relevant context selection algorithms
- Create contextual hints for task decomposition
- Add project-specific terminology detection

### 5. Performance Optimization
- Implement caching for project analysis
- Add incremental updates based on file changes
- Create indexing for faster context retrieval
- Optimize memory usage for large projects

## Success Criteria
- Successfully analyzes common project structures
- Accurately detects technologies used in the project
- Generates helpful context for LLM analysis
- Improves task decomposition quality with contextual awareness
- Handles projects of various sizes efficiently

## Dependencies
- Phase 1: Core Analysis Engine

## Technical Considerations
- Design for extensibility to support various project types
- Implement limits and safeguards for very large projects
- Consider privacy implications when analyzing project content
- Create clear separation between analysis and storage
- Develop language-specific parsers for common languages
- Support configuration for customizing analysis depth
