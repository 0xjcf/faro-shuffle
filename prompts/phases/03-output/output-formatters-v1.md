# V1 Basic Console Output Implementation

## Phase Overview (V1)
This phase focuses on implementing the **minimal viable** output formatting for faro-shuffle V1. It involves taking the analysis result (complexity score and rationale) from the previous phases and printing it clearly to the standard output (console).

*Note: Richer output formats (JSON, Markdown, colorized console, tables, templates, etc.) are deferred post-V1.*

## V1 Goals
- Implement a simple function to format and print the analysis score and rationale to the console.

## V1 Implementation Tasks

### 1. Basic Console Output (V1)
- Create a simple Rust function (e.g., `display_results(score: i32, rationale: &str)`) that takes the complexity score and rationale.
- Use standard `println!` macros to format and print the output clearly to stdout.
    - Example Format:
      ```
      Complexity Score: [score]
      Rationale: [rationale]
      ```

## V1 Success Criteria
- The implemented function correctly receives the score and rationale.
- Outputs the score and rationale clearly and legibly to the console in a predefined simple format.

## V1 Dependencies
- Phase 01 V1: Core Analysis Engine (to provide score/rationale data structure)
- Phase 02 V1: CLI Interface (to call this output function)

## V1 Technical Considerations
- Keep the implementation simple and focused on basic `println!` formatting.
- Ensure the output format is easily readable.
