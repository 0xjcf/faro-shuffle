# Command-Line Interface Implementation

## Phase Overview
This phase focuses on developing a command-line interface (CLI) for faro-shuffle, allowing users to analyze and expand tasks through simple terminal commands. The CLI will build upon the core analysis engine developed in Phase 1.

## Goals
- Create an intuitive CLI for task expansion
- Implement argument parsing with appropriate options
- Support multiple input and output formats
- Build configuration management
- Provide helpful error messages and usage instructions

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. CLI Framework Setup
- Select and implement Rust CLI framework (e.g., clap)
- Design command structure and subcommands
- Implement help text and documentation
- Create basic command routing

### 2. Command Implementation
- Implement `analyze` command for task analysis
- Add `expand` command for task decomposition
- Create `config` command for managing settings
- Implement `version` and other utility commands

### 3. Input/Output Management
- Support reading tasks from files and stdin
- Implement output to files and stdout
- Add support for different output formats (JSON, Markdown, etc.)
- Create progress indicators for long-running operations

### 4. Configuration Management
- Implement configuration file support
- Create settings for LLM providers
- Add customization options for analysis parameters
- Support environment variable configuration

### 5. Error Handling and User Experience
- Implement user-friendly error messages
- Add color-coded output for better readability
- Create verbose mode for debugging
- Implement logging with different verbosity levels

## Success Criteria
- CLI can be invoked with `faro-shuffle [command] [options]`
- Successfully analyzes tasks from files or stdin
- Outputs results in requested format
- Provides helpful error messages
- Handles configuration gracefully
- Complete help documentation

## Dependencies
- Phase 1: Core Analysis Engine
- Rust CLI framework (e.g., clap)

## Technical Considerations
- Focus on user experience and intuitive command design
- Ensure good error handling with clear messages
- Follow standard CLI conventions
- Support both interactive and scripted usage
- Consider implementing shell completions
- Ensure proper exit codes for automation
