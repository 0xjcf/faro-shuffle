# Advanced Features Implementation

## Phase Overview
This phase focuses on implementing advanced features to enhance faro-shuffle's capabilities beyond the core functionality. These features include machine learning enhancements, integration with external systems, historical analysis, and additional specialized functionality.

## Goals
- Implement machine learning to improve estimates based on actual completion times
- Create integrations with popular issue trackers and project management tools
- Develop historical analysis to track estimation accuracy
- Add specialized modes for different project types
- Enable more sophisticated visualization and reporting

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Machine Learning Enhancements
- Implement data collection for actual vs. estimated completion times
- Create ML models for prediction refinement
- Develop feedback loops for continuous improvement
- Add confidence scoring based on historical accuracy

### 2. External System Integration
- Implement GitHub Issues integration
- Create JIRA connector
- Develop integration with other issue trackers (GitLab, Azure DevOps)
- Add project management tool support (Asana, Trello, etc.)

### 3. Historical Analysis
- Create storage for historical task data
- Implement trend analysis for estimation accuracy
- Develop team velocity tracking
- Add project health metrics and reporting

### 4. Specialized Analysis Modes
- Implement domain-specific task analysis (web development, mobile, etc.)
- Create role-based task decomposition (developer, QA, design, etc.)
- Develop methodology-specific modes (Agile, Waterfall, etc.)
- Add customizable analysis templates

### 5. Advanced Visualization
- Implement interactive dependency graphs
- Create Gantt chart generation
- Develop resource allocation visualization
- Add burndown/burnup chart projections

## Success Criteria
- ML models improve estimation accuracy over time
- Successful bidirectional integration with at least two issue trackers
- Historical analysis provides useful insights on estimation patterns
- Specialized analysis modes produce noticeably different results for different contexts
- Advanced visualizations help with project planning and tracking

## Dependencies
- All previous phases (1-5)
- External API access for integrated systems

## Technical Considerations
- Design for data privacy when collecting historical information
- Implement API version handling for external integrations
- Consider computational requirements for ML features
- Support offline operation for core functionality
- Develop clear extension points for future enhancements
- Implement appropriate authentication for external system access
