# V1 Phase Readiness Assessment

This assessment evaluates the clarity, dependencies, and measurability of the **minimal V1 phases** for the faro-shuffle project, as defined in `V1_PROGRESS.md` and the V1-specific phase prompts.

| V1 Phase ID | Component         | Clarity of V1 Goal | V1 Key Tasks / Deliverables                                   | V1 Dependencies Clear? | V1 Measurable "Done" Criteria | Readiness |
|-------------|-------------------|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------|
| **01**      | Core Analysis     | Yes                | Markdown parse, Ollama call, Score/Rationale extraction       | Yes (Ollama)           | Yes                           | **High**  |
| **02**      | CLI Interface     | Yes                | `clap` setup, `analyze <file>` cmd, Call Core 01              | Yes (Needs V1 Ph 01)   | Yes                           | **High**  |
| **03**      | Basic Output      | Yes                | `println!` formatting of Score/Rationale                      | Yes (Needs V1 Ph 01, 02)| Yes                           | **High**  |

#### Why V1 Looks Solid
1.  **Minimal Scope:** The V1 phases are tightly focused on delivering the core value proposition (complexity score via CLI) with minimal dependencies.
2.  **Clear Deliverables:** Each V1 phase has very specific, achievable, and easily verifiable outputs (e.g., function calls Ollama, CLI takes file arg, output prints score).
3.  **Logical Flow:** The three V1 phases follow a simple, linear dependency chain (Core -> CLI -> Output).
4.  **High Measurability:** The success criteria for each V1 phase are concrete and directly testable.

#### V1 Areas for Attention
- **Testing Strategy:** While simplified, basic unit/integration tests for the V1 components (Ollama call, CLI arg parsing, output function) should still be planned.
- **Ollama Availability:** Ensure a local Ollama instance is reliably available for development and testing.
- **Prompt Refinement:** The initial V1 prompt for complexity analysis (`prompts/phases/01-core/task-analysis-engine-v1.md` task 2) will likely require iteration based on results.

**V1 Bottom line:** The defined V1 phases are clear, measurable, and highly focused, representing a low-risk starting point. Implementation can confidently begin with V1 Phase 01 (Core Analysis).
