# faro-shuffle V1 Implementation Progress

This file tracks the implementation status of the project phases **required for the minimal V1 release**, as defined in `PROJECT_ROADMAP.md` and the `faro-shuffle/prompts/` directory. V1 focuses on delivering the core complexity analysis via a simple CLI.

## Status Legend
- **Defined**: Phase prompt is complete but implementation has not started
- **In Progress**: Implementation has started but is not complete
- **Blocked**: Implementation cannot continue due to dependencies or issues
- **Testing**: Implementation is complete and undergoing testing/validation
- **Completed**: Phase is fully implemented and validated
- **Needs Review**: Implementation needs peer review

## ðŸš¨ HARD DEADLINE: APRIL 24, 2025
All V1 components must ship by this date, even if rough around the edges. This is a non-negotiable deadline to ensure we validate the core value proposition quickly.

## V1 Workflow Overview
The V1 release focuses on both technical implementation AND value validation:
1. Value Proposition & Pitch (New Phase)
2. Core Analysis Engine (V1 Scope - Phase 1)
3. Command-Line Interface (V1 Scope - Phase 2)
4. Basic Console Output (V1 Scope - Part of Phase 3)
5. User Acquisition Setup (New Phase)
6. Feedback Collection Plan (New Phase)

*Note: Phases 04 (Project Context), 05 (MCP), 06 (Advanced Features), and richer output formats (JSON/Markdown) from Phase 03 are deferred post-V1.*

## V1 Implementation Progress

| Phase ID | Component | V1 Description | Key Dependencies | Status      | Effort Est. | Notes |
|----------|-----------|----------------|------------------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| 00 | Value Proposition | Define killer hook, draft compelling pitch, create README intro focused on pain points and outcomes | None | Completed | X-Small (2h) | "Know instantly if your project is a 2-hour tweak or a 2-week trapâ€”before you waste time." Integrated in README.md and CLI help text. Added "Coming soon: Faro Pro" teaser. |
| 01 | Core Analysis | Simple task parsing (Markdown file), Local Ollama integration, Complexity scoring (score + rationale) | Rust, Ollama | Completed | Small (16h) | Implemented with modular architecture: task_parser module, llm_integration module (using reqwest), and complexity_scoring module. Includes robust error handling. |
| 02 | CLI Interface | Basic CLI (`clap`), reads input file, calls Core (Phase 01), displays results to console | Phase 01 | Completed | Small (12h) | Implemented with clap for arg parsing, formats output with emoji, and includes recommendations based on score. |
| 03 | Basic Output | Minimal formatted text output to console | Phase 01, 02 | Completed | X-Small (4h)| Integrated into CLI with formatted output including score, rationale, and actionable recommendation. |
| 04 | User Acquisition | Setup waitlist form, draft user outreach messages, prepare demo examples | Phase 00 | Completed | X-Small (2h) | Created WAITLIST.md with tally.so form guidance, outreach templates, and feedback questions. Created example task files. |
| 05 | Feedback Plan | Create structured questions, identify target users, setup tracking | Phases 00-04 | Completed | X-Small (1h) | Added feedback tracking guidelines in WAITLIST.md. Created direct message templates for developers and project managers. |

**Total Estimated V1 Effort: ~37 hours with AI assistance**
**Calendar Budget: 7 days (April 17-24, 2025)**
**Time to Completion: 2 days (April 17-18, 2025)**

*Note: Estimates assume AI pair programming. Speed and focus are critical - getting feedback trumps technical perfection.*

## V1 Implementation Order Rationale

The V1 phases provide the quickest path to validating the core value proposition AND setting up for growth.

### Phase 0 (Value Proposition & Pitch - NEW)
- **Foundation**: Clarifies WHAT we're selling and WHY it matters.
- **Growth Focus**: Forces us to think about the hook before writing code.
- **Marketing Asset**: Directly feeds into README and waitlist page.

### Phase 1 (Core Analysis Engine - V1 Scope)
- **Foundation**: Provides the essential V1 analysis (complexity score).
- **Technical Focus**: LLM interaction (Ollama) and basic analysis logic.
- **Validation Point**: Allows validation of the core analysis concept.

### Phase 2 (CLI Interface - V1 Scope)
- **First Interface**: Provides the primary way to interact with the V1 tool.
- **Development Tool**: Enables testing of the core engine.
- **User Feedback**: Allows early user testing of the analysis usefulness.

### Phase 3 (Basic Console Output - V1 Scope)
- **User Experience**: Ensures the analysis results are presented clearly.
- **Completeness**: Delivers the final output step for the V1 workflow.

### Phase 4 (User Acquisition Setup - NEW)
- **Growth Channel**: Creates path for collecting interested users.
- **Feedback Source**: Identifies initial test users.
- **Validation Tool**: Enables measuring actual interest beyond our own opinion.

### Phase 5 (Feedback Collection Plan - NEW)
- **Data Collection**: Ensures we gather actionable insights.
- **Decision Support**: Information needed for go/no-go on further development.
- **User-Centered**: Keeps focus on solving real problems, not just building features.

## Post-V1 Validation (By April 30th)
- Collect feedback from >= 5 target users
- Analyze value proposition validation
- Make go/no-go decision on subtask decomposition feature
- Consider monetization signals (early access/pro feature waitlist)

## Updating This File
When updating a phase's status, include:
1. The new status
2. Brief notes about progress or blockers
3. Any deviations from the original phase prompt
4. Reference the Phase Completion Report Template in `PROJECT_WORKFLOW.md` (or a V1 equivalent if created) for completed phases
