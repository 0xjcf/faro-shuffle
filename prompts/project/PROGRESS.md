# faro-shuffle Phase Implementation Progress

This file tracks the implementation status of the project phases defined in the `faro-shuffle/prompts/` directory. faro-shuffle is an AI-driven system that analyzes task complexity and generates structured subtasks to improve project planning and execution.

## Status Legend
- **Defined**: Phase prompt is complete but implementation has not started
- **In Progress**: Implementation has started but is not complete
- **Blocked**: Implementation cannot continue due to dependencies or issues
- **Testing**: Implementation is complete and undergoing testing/validation
- **Completed**: Phase is fully implemented and validated
- **Needs Review**: Implementation needs peer review

## Workflow Overview
This project follows a sequential development pattern where phases build upon previous ones:
1. Core Analysis Engine (Phase 1)
2. Command-Line Interface (Phase 2)
3. Output Formatters (Phase 3)
4. Project Context Parser (Phase 4)
5. MCP Module Implementation (Phase 5)
6. Advanced Features (Phase 6)

## Implementation Progress

| Phase ID | Component | Description | Key Dependencies | Status | Effort Est. | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------------|------------------|--------|-------------|-------|
| 01 | Core Analysis | Task parsing, LLM integration, complexity scoring | Rust, LLM API | Completed | Medium (24h) | V1: Core analysis (Markdown parse, Ollama call, score/rationale). Subtask generation deferred. |
| 02 | CLI Interface | Command-line tool with argument parsing | Phase 01 | Completed | Small (16h) | V1: Basic `analyze` command. Deferred: `expand`, `config`, `version`, stdin/file output, config mgmt. |
| 03 | Output Formats | JSON schema, Markdown templates, console output | Phase 01, 02 | In Progress | Medium (24h) | V1: Basic console output. V2: Added JSON & basic Markdown output. Deferred: Full schemas, templates, other formats. |
| 04 | Project Context | File structure analysis, technology detection | Phase 01 | Completed | Medium (32h) | V2: Implemented basic context parsing (file structure, tech detection via markers/heuristics) & LLM prompt integration. |
| 05 | MCP Integration | MCP protocol module for editor integration | Phase 01, 03 | Defined | Large (40h) | |
| 06 | Advanced Features | ML enhancements, integrations, historical analysis | Phase 01-05 | Defined | X-Large (80h) | |

**Total Estimated Effort: ~216 hours with AI assistance**

*Note: These estimates assume the use of AI pair programming tools like Cursor or Copilot. Without AI assistance, estimates would be approximately 1.5-2x higher.*

## Implementation Order Rationale

The phase numbering directly reflects the recommended implementation order for optimal development workflow.

### Phase 1 (Core Analysis Engine)
- **Foundation**: Provides the essential analysis functionality all other components will use
- **Technical Complexity**: Handles the most complex logic of LLM interaction and task analysis
- **Validation Point**: Early development allows validation of the core concept before building interfaces
- **Standalone Utility**: Can provide immediate value even without full interface implementation

### Phase 2 (CLI Interface)
- **First Interface**: Provides the simplest way to interact with the core analysis engine
- **Development Tool**: Enables easier testing and debugging of the core engine
- **User Feedback**: Allows for early user testing and feedback on the analysis quality
- **Deployment Path**: Creates a distributable tool that can be used immediately

### Phase 3 (Output Formatters)
- **Standardization**: Establishes the output formats all interfaces will use
- **Integration Point**: Enables interoperability with other tools and systems
- **User Experience**: Improves readability and utility of analysis results
- **Documentation**: Serves as living documentation of the analysis format

### Phase 4 (Project Context Parser)
- **Enhanced Analysis**: Enriches the core analysis with project-specific context
- **Accuracy Improvement**: Significantly improves the quality of task breakdown
- **Technology Awareness**: Makes the system adaptable to different project types

### Phase 5 (MCP Integration)
- **Editor Integration**: Brings the analysis capabilities directly into the development environment
- **Workflow Enhancement**: Integrates with existing developer workflows
- **Interactive Experience**: Provides richer interaction than command-line alone

### Phase 6 (Advanced Features)
- **System Maturity**: Builds on the stable foundation established by previous phases
- **Value Multiplier**: Enhances the core functionality with advanced capabilities
- **Ecosystem Integration**: Connects with broader development ecosystem tools
