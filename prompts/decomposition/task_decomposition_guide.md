# Task Decomposition Guide

## Purpose
This guide provides a systematic approach to breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable components to improve estimation accuracy, enable parallel work, reduce risk, and track progress more effectively.

## Decomposition Principles

### 1. Clear Boundaries
Each sub-task should:
- Have well-defined inputs and outputs
- Be independently testable where possible
- Have minimal overlap with other sub-tasks

### 2. Appropriate Granularity
- Sub-tasks should be completable in 1-3 days (ideal)
- If a sub-task exceeds 5 days, consider further decomposition
- Avoid over-decomposition that creates excessive management overhead

### 3. Logical Cohesion
Group related activities that:
- Involve the same system component
- Require the same skill set
- Have high technical cohesion

### 4. Value-Oriented Sequencing
Sequence sub-tasks to:
- Deliver tangible value earlier
- Validate critical assumptions quickly
- Reduce overall risk profile

## Decomposition Methods

### Functional Decomposition
Break down by feature/functionality:
1. Identify distinct features or use cases
2. Separate interface from implementation
3. Isolate data structures from processing logic
4. Extract common utilities/services

Example:
```
Task: Implement user authentication system
Decomposition:
- Design authentication data model
- Implement registration form and validation
- Create account creation backend logic
- Implement login form and validation
- Create session management
- Implement password reset functionality
- Add email verification system
- Create authentication middleware
- Implement user profile view/edit
```

### Technical Layer Decomposition
Break down by technical architecture:
1. Separate frontend/UI components
2. Identify backend/API requirements
3. Isolate data persistence needs
4. Extract cross-cutting concerns

Example:
```
Task: Add product search feature
Decomposition:
- UI: Search input component
- UI: Search results display component
- API: Search endpoint implementation
- Backend: Search query builder
- Backend: Search indexing service
- Data: Database query optimization
- Testing: Unit tests for search logic
- Testing: Integration tests for search flows
```

### Iterative Enhancement
Break down by increasing sophistication:
1. Create minimal viable implementation
2. Identify enhancement iterations
3. Prioritize enhancements by value/complexity

Example:
```
Task: Implement data visualization dashboard
Decomposition:
- MVP: Basic table view of key metrics
- Enhancement 1: Add sorting and filtering
- Enhancement 2: Basic bar charts for top metrics
- Enhancement 3: Add time-series trend graphs
- Enhancement 4: Interactive filtering across charts
- Enhancement 5: User-customizable dashboard layout
- Enhancement 6: Export and sharing capabilities
```

## Decomposition Process

### 1. Initial Analysis
- Review overall task requirements and context
- Identify major functional components
- Map dependencies between components
- Note constraints and non-functional requirements

### 2. Hierarchy Construction
- Create a hierarchy of tasks and sub-tasks
- Aim for 2-3 levels for most projects
- Deeper hierarchies may be needed for very complex tasks
- Keep leaf nodes (lowest level) completion time to 1-3 days

### 3. Task Attribute Definition
For each sub-task, define:
- Clear description/objective
- Expected inputs/outputs
- Acceptance criteria
- Required skills
- Dependencies on other tasks

### 4. Dependency Mapping
- Identify predecessors (must happen before)
- Identify successors (must happen after)
- Mark tasks that can happen in parallel
- Identify critical path items

### 5. Validation
- Review for completeness (does it cover everything?)
- Check for redundancy (any duplicated work?)
- Confirm appropriate granularity
- Verify with stakeholders and team members

## Decomposition Patterns for Common Scenarios

### Software Development Tasks

#### New Feature Implementation
1. Design phase (UX, architecture)
2. UI component implementation
3. API/service layer implementation
4. Data persistence implementation
5. Integration phase
6. Test suite development
7. Documentation and polish

#### Bug Fix/Performance Issue
1. Reproduction and analysis
2. Root cause investigation
3. Solution design
4. Implementation
5. Validation and testing
6. Documentation update

### Research and Exploration Tasks

#### Technology Evaluation
1. Requirements/criteria definition
2. Candidate identification
3. Individual candidate evaluation
4. Comparative analysis
5. Proof of concept development
6. Recommendation and documentation

#### User Research
1. Research question definition
2. Methodology selection
3. Participant recruitment
4. Research execution
5. Data analysis
6. Findings documentation
7. Recommendations development

## Tools and Templates

### Task Breakdown Template

```
Task Title: [Name]
Objective: [Clear outcome statement]

Sub-Tasks:
1. [Sub-task name]
   - Description: [Brief description]
   - Inputs: [Required inputs]
   - Outputs: [Expected outputs]
   - Acceptance Criteria: [List of criteria]
   - Dependencies: [List of dependent tasks]
   - Estimated Effort: [Time or points]

2. [Sub-task name]
   ...

Risks and Considerations:
- [List of identified risks]
- [Special considerations]
```

### Visualization Methods
- Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) diagrams
- Task dependency graphs
- Kanban board with task hierarchies
- Mind maps for initial brainstorming

## Pitfalls to Avoid

### Common Decomposition Mistakes
- Creating dependencies where none are necessary
- Failing to identify hidden dependencies
- Over-decomposing simple tasks
- Under-decomposing complex tasks
- Ignoring cross-cutting concerns
- Focusing on activities rather than deliverables

### Warning Signs of Poor Decomposition
- Sub-tasks with vague definitions
- Too many dependencies between sub-tasks
- All sub-tasks estimated at similar size
- Sub-tasks that cannot be independently tested
- Frequent need to work across multiple sub-tasks simultaneously

## Continuous Improvement

After project completion, review the decomposition effectiveness:
1. Which sub-tasks were accurately estimated?
2. Which required further breakdown during implementation?
3. Were there hidden dependencies discovered later?
4. How could the decomposition be improved for similar future tasks?
