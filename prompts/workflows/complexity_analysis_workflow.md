# Task Complexity Analysis Workflow

## Purpose
This workflow defines the process for analyzing and scoring task complexity to determine appropriate task decomposition, resource allocation, and risk management strategies.

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Task Intake
- Receive task description and requirements
- Assign unique task ID
- Document initial task scope and objectives
- Capture expected deliverables and constraints

### 2. Initial Assessment
- Review task description and requirements
- Identify key complexity factors relevant to the task
- Determine if specialized knowledge areas are required
- Identify initial dependencies and integration points

### 3. Complexity Scoring
- Complete the Task Complexity Scoring template
- Rate each complexity factor objectively
- Provide detailed justification for each score
- Calculate raw and weighted complexity scores
- Determine complexity classification

### 4. Decomposition Decision
- For "Simple" tasks (score 0-2.5):
  - Decomposition generally not needed
  - Proceed with standard implementation approach
  
- For "Moderate" tasks (score 2.6-5.0):
  - Consider light decomposition (2-3 subtasks)
  - Focus on natural work breakdown structure
  
- For "Complex" tasks (score 5.1-7.5):
  - Decomposition strongly recommended (4-7 subtasks)
  - Create detailed task dependencies
  - Identify critical path items
  
- For "Very Complex" tasks (score 7.6-10):
  - Mandatory comprehensive decomposition (8+ subtasks)
  - Consider breaking into multiple related tasks
  - Implement additional oversight and review points

### 5. Task Decomposition (if required)
- Use the Task Decomposition Template for breakdown
- Ensure subtasks address all complexity factors
- Define clear interfaces between subtasks
- Establish checkpoints and integration tests

### 6. Resource Planning
- Identify required skills based on complexity factors
- Allocate resources according to specialization needs
- Consider pairing for knowledge transfer on complex items
- Adjust time estimates based on complexity classification

### 7. Risk Management
- Document risks identified during complexity analysis
- Create mitigation strategies for high complexity factors
- Schedule additional review points for complex areas
- Establish clear escalation paths for uncertainty areas

### 8. Validation and Approval
- Review complexity analysis with stakeholders
- Validate decomposition approach with technical leads
- Adjust analysis based on feedback
- Obtain final approval on complexity assessment and task plan

## Outputs
- Completed Task Complexity Scoring document
- Task Decomposition document (for tasks requiring decomposition)
- Resource plan with skills mapping
- Risk register with mitigation strategies
- Approved implementation timeline
