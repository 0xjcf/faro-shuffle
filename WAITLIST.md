## Sample Outreach Messages

### Direct Message Template (Developers/Freelancers)

```
Hi [Name],

I built a small CLI tool called faro-shuffle that I'd love your feedback on. It analyzes task descriptions and tells you how complex they really are before you commit to them.

It takes 60 seconds to try out - just write a task in markdown and the tool rates its complexity from 1-10 with a brief explanation.

Would you be willing to test it out on a couple of your tasks and share what you think? I'm especially curious if it helps you avoid time estimation traps.

Thanks!

### Direct Message Template (Project Managers)

```
Hi [Name],

I've created a task analysis tool called faro-shuffle that might help with project planning. It uses AI to analyze task descriptions and provide an objective complexity score (1-10).

I'm looking for feedback from experienced project managers like yourself. Would you be willing to test it on a few of your team's tasks to see if it helps with estimation accuracy?

It takes less than a minute to try and could potentially save hours of planning debates. Let me know if you're interested!

Thanks,
[Your Name]
```

### Follow-up Questions for Feedback

After users try the tool, ask these specific questions:

1. Was the complexity score accurate based on your experience with similar tasks?
2. Did the rationale provide useful insights?
3. Would this tool help you make better decisions about task planning?
4. Would you pay for advanced features like subtask breakdown or team reports?
5. What would make this tool more valuable to you?

## Tracking Feedback

Create a simple spreadsheet or Notion database with:
- User name/contact
- Date of feedback
- Tasks analyzed
- Complexity scores
- User comments
- Interest in Pro features
- Action items based on feedback

Update this tracking after each conversation to identify patterns and priorities for future development.
